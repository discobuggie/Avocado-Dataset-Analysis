# Introduction

The dataset originates from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices) and focuses on avocado-related information. For further details about its source and content, interested individuals may refer to Kaggle's website, specifically the section dedicated to avocado data. The dataset encompasses data regarding the prices of Hass avocados and the quantity sold for various avocado types across different time periods. Originally, this data was provided by the Hass Avocado Board. Here's how they describe the data on their website:
>The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

# Ask

<h3>Business Task</h3>  
It is a well known fact that Millenials LOVE Avocado Toast. It's also a well known fact that all Millenials live in their parents basements. Clearly, they aren't buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast! But maybe there's hope… if a Millenial could find a city with cheap avocados, they could live out the Millenial American Dream. The dataset contains intriguing variables, including the average price, total sales volume, quantity of bags sold, and avocado type. Upon examining these columns, I found myself pondering a couple of questions to explore further. Firstly, I wondered if the recent trend of millennials' admiration for 'avocado toast' has <strong>contributed to a surge in the total volume of avocado sale</strong>. Additionally, I was curious about the <strong>price trends</strong>., considering that avocados have transformed from the not-so-appealing green smoothie of childhood to an Instagram-worthy meal. Uncovering the answers to these questions could shed light on the impact of changing perceptions and preferences surrounding avocados.

The data is stored appropriately and is now prepared for analysis. I queried multiple relevant tables for the analysis and visualized them in Tableau.

&nbsp;Q. 1. Which type of Avocados are more in demand (Conventional or Organic)?  
Just over 2% of our dataset is organic. Conventional are more in demand and the average price of avocados reached their peak in 2017, 
around $1.52.

&nbsp;Q. 2 & 3. What are TOP 5 regions where average price and average consumption are very high?

Amidst these dynamics, Houston emerges as an attractive destination for avocado enthusiasts seeking cost-effective indulgence.

&nbsp;Q. 4 & 5. In which year and for which region was the Average price the highest, and which is the best city for millenials to have their avocado toast AND buy a home??  
The pink represents the year 2017 and is moslty the last dot to appear in every year when describing average prices. It appears that Avocado prices experienced a significant surge due to heightened demand in the San Francisco region during the year 2017. This trend is widely acknowledged and can be verified through a quick Google search.
